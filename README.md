Backboner is a Julia package that offers a set of types and functions for working with molecular backbones. It also includes functions for working with protein chains, reading/writing PDB files and assigning secondary structure.

## Installation

Backboner is a registered Julia package, and can be installed with the Julia package manager:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Backboner")
```

## Overview

The `Backbone` type is a wrapper for a 3xN matrix of coordinates representing absolute positions of atoms of a continuous molecular backbone. For working with the geometry of a backbone, the `ChainedBonds` type exists to store bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles of a continuous chain of bonds.

The `Protein` submodule contains functions and types for working specifically with proteins. A protein can be loaded from a PDB file using the `Backboner.Protein.readpdb` function, which returns a `Vector{Backboner.Protein.Chain}`. Inversely, a `Vector{Backboner.Protein.Chain}` instance can be written to a PDB file using the `writepdb` function.

**Note:** The `Protein` submodule is not exported by default, but can be imported explicitly with: `using/import Backboner.Protein`.

## Example

```julia
julia> using Backboner, Backboner.Protein

julia> protein = readpdb("test/data/1ZAK.pdb")
2-element Vector{Chain}:
 Chain A with 220 residues
 Chain B with 220 residues

julia> chain = protein["A"]
Chain A with 220 residues

julia> chain.backbone
